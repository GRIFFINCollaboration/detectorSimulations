Changes:

DetectionSystemBrilliance380V1.cc		:
- Removed Sensitive detector header files
- Modified Build() function to remove dependence on sensitive detector

DetectionSystemGriffin.cc						:
- Removed dependence on sensitive detector

DetectionSystemSpiceV02.cc					:
- Removed dependence on sensitive detector

DetectionSystemSpice.cc							:
- Removed dependence on sensitive detector

DetectionSystemPaces.cc							:
- Removed dependence on sensitive detector

EventAction.cc											:
- No longer writes data to HEX files. Instead, it will create a histogram using HistoManager.cc
- Each detector has its own function for creating a histogram, and these are called in EndOfEventAction(event). 
- ClearVariables function introduced to initialize all of the data arrays for each detector. 

RunAction.cc												:
- This file has been shortened significantly. It now just waits until the run is complete, 
Then writes the file to disk. It no longer prepares any hex flags since there are no more hex files. 
If this is a major problem then it can be reinstated, but for the time being I will leave it 
to just write root files. 

DetectorMessenger.cc								:
- Added commands for grid and box

DetectorConstruction.cc							:
- No longer builds all detectors before any are actually called. 'Experimental Hall' has been replaced with 'World'. 
- Added 'Box' and 'Grid' detection systems. 
- 

HistoManager.cc											:
- Added outputs for Sceptar, 8pi, spice, and paces. 
- Writes output in a seemingly inefficient manner. All files need a seperate name so there are many 
statements that have very similar functions. There should be a clever way to put this into a loop. 

HistoManager.hh											:
- Added output file names to the HISTONAME list for the detectors added in HistoManager.cc. 

ApparatusFieldBox.cc								:
- Removed inclusion of SencitiveDetector.hh and G4SDManager.hh

ApparatusGenericTarget.cc						:
- Removed inclusion of SensitiveDetector.hh and G4SDManager.hh

Apparatus8piVacuumChamber.cc				:
- Removed inclusion of SensitiveDetector.hh and G4SDManager.hh

Apparatus8piCavuumChamberAuxMatShell.cc :
- Removed inclusion of SensitiveDetector.hh and G4SDManager.hh

ApparatusSpicetargetChamber.cc			:
- Removed inclusion of SensitiveDetector.hh and G4SDManager.hh

DetectionSystem8pi.cc								:
- Removed SensitiveDetector Dependence

DetectionSystemGammaTracking.cc			:
- Removed SensitiveDetector Dependence

DetectionSystemSodiumIodide.cc			:
- Removed SensitiveDetector Dependence

PrimaryGeneratorAction							:
- Introduced isoRadOnBox

I have likely missed a few files on here as I didnt always update this immediately, but the big changes include:

- No more HEX file output, root file output instead. 
- No more sensitive detectors
- Two added objects: Grid and Box.
