Notes :
The code is modular, we should keep it this way, A detector <=> separate writing class 
For each new detector a "Setter" root-class must be written.

To add another "Setter" class for another detector :

- All the files corresponding to the "Setter" class goes in the folder dataRootClass/ (${myROOTclassDir} in the CMakeLists.txt)
- copy the New_linkdef.h in the directory ${myROOTclassDir} and Replace "New" by the name of your detector
- Change the Makefile in dataRootClass/ to compile the new files, 'make clean' and 'make' to create the libraries
	- go to the block [ # Specify Shared libraries ]
			- Add the name of the new shared library correponding to the new detector
				e.g.  SHARELIB      = libSpiceData.so  libS3Data.so  libGriffinData.so
	- go to the block [ # Create dictionaries and compile ]
			- Copy the commented block with detector "New"
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector
	- go to the block [ # Manage dependances ]
			- Copy the commented block with detector "New"
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector


- change the CMakeLists.txt under the detectorSimulations (INSTALL) directory
	- go to the block [ # Adding a variable to use root through out the G4 project ]
			- Declare the root class in the CMakeLists on top by copying [ #set(myROOTNewclass 	TNewData.cpp) ]
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector
	- go to the block [ # Use root in the project ] 
			- Copy the commented block with detector "New"
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector (don't forget to specify the dictionary file that is generated by rootcint (starting with "dict"), you will use it in the next step.)
			- Each detector has a name_linkdef.h file that could be used to specify some options while adding a class in root, 
	- go to the block [ # Add the executable, and link it to the Geant4 libraries ]
			- Copy commented block with detector "New"
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector (the dictionary file must be the same)


- Finally, in ./src/RootManager.hh,  add the header of the new class and use it 

e.g. 

#include "RawG4Event.hh"
#include "relative/path/to/dataRootClass/TSpiceData.h" 
>>> #include "relative/path/to/dataRootClass/TNewData.h" <<<
