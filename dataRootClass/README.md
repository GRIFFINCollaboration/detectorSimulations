Notes :
The code is modular, we should keep it this way, A detector <=> separate writing class 
For each new detector a "Setter" root-class must be written.

To add another "Setter" class for another detector :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- All the files corresponding to the "Setter" class goes in the folder dataRootClass/ (${myROOTclassDir} in the CMakeLists.txt)
- copy the New_linkdef.h in the directory ${myROOTclassDir} and Replace "New" by the name of your detector
- Change the Makefile in dataRootClass/ to compile the new files, 'make clean' and 'make' to create the libraries
	- go to the block [ # Specify Shared libraries ]
			- Add the name of the new shared library correponding to the new detector
				e.g.  SHARELIB      = libSpiceData.so  libS3Data.so  libGriffinData.so
	- go to the block [ # Create dictionaries and compile ]
			- Copy the commented block with detector "New"
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector
	- go to the block [ # Manage dependances ]
			- Copy the commented block with detector "New"
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector


- change the CMakeLists.txt under the detectorSimulations (INSTALL) directory
	- go to the block [ # Adding a variable to use root through out the G4 project ]
			- Declare the root class in the CMakeLists on top by copying [ #set(myROOTNewclass 	TNewData.cpp) ]
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector
	- go to the block [ # Use root in the project ] 
			- Copy the commented block with detector "New"
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector (don't forget to specify the dictionary file that is generated by rootcint (starting with "dict"), you will use it in the next step.)
			- Each detector has a name_linkdef.h file that could be used to specify some options while adding a class in root, 
	- go to the block [ # Add the executable, and link it to the Geant4 libraries ]
			- Copy commented block with detector "New"
			- Replace "New" by the name of your detector (the dictionary file must be the same)


- Finally, in ./src/RootManager.hh,  add the header of the new class and use it 

e.g. 

#include "RawG4Event.hh"
#include "relative/path/to/dataRootClass/TSpiceData.h" 
>>> #include "relative/path/to/dataRootClass/TNewData.h" <<<

================================================================================


To add TTigFragment structure :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The main idea here is to create a simulated tree that ressembles to the actual real data from TIGRESS/GRIFFIN/SPICE etc..
- The DAQ system at TRIUMF write the Data in MIDAS format, this file is than parsed with GRSISPOON to produce what is know as the "Fragment tree", which is a ROOT tree
- The TTigFragment class is how the Data are stored in the "Fragment tree"
- The TTigFrgament is like any other class and should be implemented in the same way
- Some members of this class will not be used (i.e. filled) in the simulation, however we recommend to keep the class as close as possible to the actual class in the GRSISPOON project.
- The GRSISPOON project is under developpement, so one needs to update this class accordingly with each GRSISPOON production version.
- In order to produce a "real-data-like" fragment tree, one needs to comment all the other detector branches in the function RootManager::SetTree() function.

- The steps to import this class are as follows :
	- Copy the header files TFragment.h and TTigFragment.h from the GRSISPOON project under the directory : $GRSISYS/include/   to   detectorSimulations/dataRootClass/
	- Copy the implementation files TFragment.cxx and TTigFragment.cxx from the GRSISPOON project under the directory : $GRSISYS/libraries/TigFormat/   to   detectorSimulations/dataRootClass/
	- Change the suffix from .cxx to .cpp for the implementation files
	- Inside TigFragment.h, comment the lines : 
			//#ifndef __CINT__
			//#include "Globals.h"
			//#endif
	- Inside TTigFragment.cpp, replace int64_t by Long64_t (known by ROOT)
	- In detectorSimulations/dataRootClass/ : 	>make clean  and >make
	
	
 << NB 1 >> : The implemetation in the dataRootClass/Makefile, the CMakeLists.txt and the detectorSimulation is similar to the implementation of any new data class.   
 << NB 2 >> : TTigFragment class inherits from TFragment class, which explains the need of importing the TFragment class as well.
