The 8pi branch will be used for supporting legacy 8pi code in isolation from TIGRESS and GRIFFIN development.  This branch may be merged back into master, iff:
- All 8pi-specific code is well factored into its own functions and files.
- no changes to anything called by GRIFFIN or TIGRESS simulations are made.
